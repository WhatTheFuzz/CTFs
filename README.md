# CTF Writeups

Hey there, I'm Sean and I enjoy doing CTF problems in my spare time. My current
position has me doing a lot of binary exploitation and software reverse
engineering so I tend to focus on those categories. Most writeups that I see
online suck and I hope these do a better job explaining some of the fundamental
concepts.

In all of my solutions I try my best to include a reproducible solution written
with pwntools. It's not about the flags, but about the journey that got us the
flag.

Hopefully this doesn't age like milk, but I've also tried to do some video
walkthroughs of some of these CTF problems. You can view them on
[YouTube][youtube].
