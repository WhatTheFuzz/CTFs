# picoGym Write-ups

I enjoy doing Capture the Flags (CTFs), particularly binary exploitation and 
reverse engineering. My current job has me doing both a lot of software reverse 
engineering and mentorship. A lot of the other write-ups that I've seen online 
are geared towards individuals who already have a solid understanding of how 
computers work. I figured I would combine these three aspects and attempt to 
make write-ups for even simple challenges that walk through each step of my 
thought process so others, who maybe don't have a computer background, can 
learn as well. If I fail at this, please post an issue or submit a merge request.
I love working with others!
