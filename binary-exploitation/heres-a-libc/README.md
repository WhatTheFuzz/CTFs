# Here's a LIBC

## Introduction

Here's a LIBC is the third challenge in the binary exploitation category. The description states:

> I am once again asking for you to pwn this binary vuln libc.so.6 Makefile nc mercury.picoctf.net 49464

It provides links to the vulnerable executable, a specific libc libray, and the Makefile.

## Information Gathering

### Hint #1

> PWNTools has a lot of useful features for getting offsets.

Hmm...this sounds like maybe we need to know the offset to something in libc. I guess we won't know unless we keep diving in!

### Glibc

Since it's in the title, it must be important. Let's figure out what version of libc we are dealing with:

![grep](./resources/grep.svg)

As we learned in the last challenge we did, Cache Me Outside, glibc 2.27 was the version after per-thread caches were introduced. We don't really know much more than that at the moment, though.

### Security settings

`Checksec`, a great program included with `pwntools`, gives us this information about the program `vuln`.

![checksec](./resources/checksec.svg)

The lack of vulnerability mitigations opens up a bunch of doors like smashing the stack, stack execution, or ROP/JOP. The executable is also not stripped which should make decompilation and debugging easier.
