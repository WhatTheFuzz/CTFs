# Stonks

## Introduction
Stonks is the first challenge for Binary Exploitation. The description says: "I decided to try something noone [sic] else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c `nc mercury.picoctf.net 53437`"

## Information Gathering

### Hint 1
> Okay, maybe I'd believe you if you find my API key.

Just one hint this time! Yikes! API stands for application programming interface. It is used to refer to the standard that defines how two separate component communicate with each other. Think of it like how you receive letter grades in school. You hand in your papers and you receive a grade back. That transaction represents an underlying API. 

In this case, the API key is referring to an alphanumeric string that we can provide this networked application that will tell it who we are. Consider it like a password of sorts - it is unique to certain individuals or projects. 

The hint is telling us to take a look at how the API key is read into the program or maybe the API key is hardcoded to a certain value. We will have to take a look!

### Running the Program
The description tells us how to run the program: `nc mercury.picoctf.net 53437`. The program `nc` is short for `netcat` and is used for all things networking. With it, we can communicate to an existing socket, open our own, or scan ports. Take a look at `man nc` to learn about all of it's common uses (it even has great examples). `nc` typically takes a destination address and a port as an argument. In this case, we are specifying that we would like to connect to `mercury.picoctf.net` over port 53437 using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

Let's try doing this in our terminal:

```
$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 53437
Welcome back to the trading app!

What would you like to do?
1) Buy some stonks!
2) View my portfolio
```

We are met with a prompt asking for a 1 or 2 to perform certain actions. Other characters don't seem to work. Entering `5` for example causes it to tell us "Goodbye!". 

Entering `1` prompts us for out API token:
```
Using patented AI algorithms to buy stonks
Stonks chosen
What is your API token?
```

Entering a short value here seems to work and give us a few stocks that were purchased for us. This ends to program.

Running it again (you will have to terminate the program with Ctrl+C) and choosing the second option shows us our portfolio and exits the program.
```
Portfolio as of Sun Aug  1 22:03:52 UTC 2021


You don't own any stonks!
Goodbye!
```

By playing with the program, we have identified two locations where a user can provide input: selecting 1 or 2 (or really anything else) to select the command and the API key. This is key to finding bugs! It's hard to get a bug where there is no user input. 

But there is more! In the description we were provided with the source code for `vuln.c`. Let's take a look at some key parts (comments are my own).

```c
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	setbuf(stdout, NULL); /* Information will be written to stdout as soon as it is written. */
	srand(time(NULL)); /* Seed a random number. */
	Portfolio *p = initialize_portfolio(); /* Allocate some memory and set some values. */
	if (!p) {
		printf("Memory failure\n");
		exit(1);
	}

	int resp = 0;

	printf("Welcome back to the trading app!\n\n");
	printf("What would you like to do?\n");
	printf("1) Buy some stonks!\n");
	printf("2) View my portfolio\n");
	scanf("%d", &resp); /* User input #1. Take text from stdin and convert it to its integer representation. */

	if (resp == 1) {
		buy_stonks(p); /* This looks interesting! */
	} else if (resp == 2) {
		view_portfolio(p); /* This looks interesting! */
	}

	free_portfolio(p);
	printf("Goodbye!\n"); /* Free up our allocated memory. */

	exit(0);
}
```
I always like starting with `main`. Even without looking at the rest of the code, it contextualizes a lot of what is going on and shows us some of the paths that program takes. The above codeblock, in a nutshell, creates some Portfolio structure, reads in user input, checks if it is a 1 or a 2, and calls `buy_stonks` or `view_portfolio`. Okay, we don't see anything about flags here, so maybe we should check out `buy_stonks`.

```c
int buy_stonks(Portfolio *p) {
	if (!p) { /* Check that this is initialized. */
		return 1;
	}
	char api_buf[FLAG_BUFFER]; */ Ooo, a static buffer of 128 bytes. */
	FILE *f = fopen("api","r"); /* Opening the flag file, this looks promising. */
	if (!f) {
		printf("Flag file not found. Contact an admin.\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	fgets(api_buf, FLAG_BUFFER, f); /* Read 128 bytes from f and place them into api_buf. */

	int money = p->money; /* This is a random number from 0-2018. */
	int shares = 0;
	Stonk *temp = NULL;
	printf("Using patented AI algorithms to buy stonks\n");
	while (money > 0) {
		shares = (rand() % money) + 1;
		temp = pick_symbol_with_AI(shares); /* Maybe look at this? */
		temp->next = p->head;
		p->head = temp;
		money -= shares;
	}
	printf("Stonks chosen\n");

	// TODO: Figure out how to read token from file, for now just ask

	char *user_buf = malloc(300 + 1);
	printf("What is your API token?\n");
	scanf("%300s", user_buf); /* User input #2. Get user input and make a string of 300 characters. */
	printf("Buying stonks with token:\n");
	printf(user_buf); /* Bug alert! We are passing user controlled data into this string formatter and aren't giving it the proper amount of arguments! */

	// TODO: Actually use key to interact with API

	view_portfolio(p);

	return 0;
}
```
Okay, so this code block looks really promising. It tells us that it is opening and reading the flag and storing the value on the stack, but never actually showing us. Later, we have a format string vulnerability where we control the input.
